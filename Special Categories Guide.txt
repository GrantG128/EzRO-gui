name:	This is what the category will be named in EzRO. It is also the name of
		the folder that roms from this category will be exported to if
		'Create Folders for Special Categories' is enabled*.
		If necessary, special characters (such as colons) will automatically
		be removed from folder names, so you don't have to worry about
		working around those.

keywords:	Any roms with one of these keywords (these can also be phrases
			containing spaces) are considered to be part of this category.

description:	Optional; This is the description that appears when you move
				your mouse over the category. If you don't want a description,
				simply don't include this.

exclusiveSystems:	Optional; This is an array of systems where this category
					will appear. If you do not include this, the category will
					appear for all systems.

* If a rom is in multiple categories, the topmost category will take priority
while lower categories will be subfolders.
